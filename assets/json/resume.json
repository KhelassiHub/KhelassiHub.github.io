We show how the execution time variability can be exploited in mixed criticality real-time systems. We propose a heuristic to compute the execution time budget to be allocated to each low criticality real-time task according to its execution time variability. We show using experiments and simulations that the proposed heuristic reduces the probability of exceeding the allocated budget compared to algorithms which do not take into account the execution time variability parameter."}],"skills":[{"name":"Physics","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Quantum Mechanics","Quantum Computing","Quantum Information","Quantum Cryptography","Quantum Communication","Quantum Teleportation"]}],"languages":[{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""},{"language":"French","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""},{"language":"Arabic","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Computer science","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Real-time systems","Quantum Computing","Quantum Teleportation"]}],"references":[{"name":"Associate Professor Yasmina Abdeddaïm","icon":"fa-solid fa-thumbtack","reference":"https://perso.esiee.fr/~abdedday/"},{"name":"Professor Eva DOKLADALOVA","icon":"fa-solid fa-thumbtack","reference":"http://dokladae.free.fr/blog/"}],"projects":[{"name":"Quantum Computing","summary":"Quantum computing is the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation.
