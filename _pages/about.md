I'm a Ph.D. student specializing in real-time systems, currently conducting research at the University of Gustave Eiffel's Laboratory of Computer Science (LIGM). 

My doctoral work focuses on understanding execution time variability, building upon my previous studies which include a Master's degree from the University of Paris Saclay in SETI (Embedded Systems and Information Processing).
